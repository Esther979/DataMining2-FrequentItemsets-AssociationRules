# DataMining2-FrequentItemsets-AssociationRules
The problem of discovering association rules between itemsets in a sales transaction database:  
1. Implement the A-Priori algorithm for finding frequent itemsets with support at least s in a dataset of sales transactions.
2. Develop and implement an algorithm for generating association rules between frequent itemsets discovered using the A-Priori algorithm in a dataset of sales transactions.
